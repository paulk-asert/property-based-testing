# Property Based Testing

Property-based testing is an approach to testing that involves checking that a system meets
certain expected properties. The approach is frequently promoted as a desired technique when
adopting a functional style of programming. It typically involves guiding the generation of
large data sets using a generator framework which can be much less work than coding large
test suites by hand. The examples in this repo are the basis for the talk at the following URL:

It looks at the concepts behind this approach and some of the available libraries.
The examples are mostly in Groovy but also in a few other JVM languages.
The concepts apply across all languages.
Property-based testing libraries are available for most languages.
